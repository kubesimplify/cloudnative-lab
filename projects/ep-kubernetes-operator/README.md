## Aim

To learn the concepts involved and build a **Kubernetes Operator** from scratch!

## Technologies being used

- Go
- Kubernetes API
- [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)

## Project Breakdown/Milestones

### Day 1 - Basics of Go
- [x] Basic data types
- [x] Structs
- [x] Pointers
- [x] Interfaces
- [x] Basic overview for packages and exports 
- [x] Go-routine (optional)

### Day 2 - Kubernetes Concepts 

**Why Build a Kubernetes Operator?**

- [ ] What is a Kubernetes Operator (Resource + controller)
- [ ] Explain kubernetes as a platform.
- [ ] Explain Resources as ‚ÄúCore blocks‚Äù of the platform (use examples).
- [ ] Explain Controller as ‚ÄúDriver of Core blocks‚Äù of the platform 
- [ ] Explain ‚ÄúExtending Kubernetes without changing main code‚Äù.

**Pre-requisites (Kubernetes API server)**

- [ ] Kubectl under the hood.
- [ ] Explain API conventions.
- [ ] Explain Group, Version, Resource and Kinds.
- [ ] Kind v/s Resource **(IMP)**
